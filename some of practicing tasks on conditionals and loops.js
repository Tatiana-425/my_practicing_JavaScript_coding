Task 1: using if-else statements 

The movie theater has a variable pricing 
system that works as follows:
    
    - If the customer is 65 or older, they get a senior discount and pay $7.
    - If the customer is between the ages of 14 and 24, they get a student discount 
      and pay $6. 
    - If the customer is under the age of 14, they get a child discount and pay $5. 
    - If the customer is an adult between the ages of 25 and 64, they pay a normal 
      price of $10.
    - If the customer is a Movie Club member, they pay $0. 
    
    1. Write a series of if-else statements that check the values of the variables 
       below and console.log the appropriate price.

       of text characters), the message "Invalid input" is returned in the console.

Task 1: Working with if-else statements and loops 

    Imagine you're creating a wedding planning app. Someone is using the app 
    to help them plan the seating arrangements for a wedding reception. As 
    part of those arrangements, the user wants the placemats at the tables to 
    match the theme colors of the wedding, which are white, pink, and blue. There 
    are 10 placemats at each table. They want the first and last placemats 
    at each table to be white, and they want the rest of the placemats to 
    alternate between pink and blue. 
    
    1. Using a for loop and if-else conditional statements, console.log 
       the colors and their corresponding placemat numbers.  
    2. Check that your results appear as follows:
